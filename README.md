Needs 4 wired to interface with the Mettler Toledo PB1502 or similar models to get both data logging and a serial interface for live data capture. 
GND,  5 V as well as I2C (SDA and SCL). In my case all 4 are easily accesible at an unpopulated header. Otherwise the datasheet for the display driver will tell you where to look.
In my case the display (LCD) driver is a PCF8576 https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCF8576.pdf
ÂµC is a N80C32 file:///C:/Users/Leo/Desktop/TD87C54.PDF
